# LLM-Design-Decisions
This repo explores trade-offs in LLM design with side-by-side experiments.

## Structure
- `with_memory_vs_without/`
- `rag_vs_finetune/`
- `single_agent_vs_multi_agent/`
- `open_source_vs_paid/`

Each folder contains experiments, explanations, and results comparing different design approaches.

## Goal
The goal is to provide practical insights into how different design choices affect LLM applications.
